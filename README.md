# debit-credit-deducer
C++ program to determine if a specified transaction is debit or credit

## Why?

This program was written by me in 2023(aged 17) to aid me in Accountancy homework, and help me understand the concept behind the deductions. Our school taught us some memonics but they were never 100% correct in all scenarios. So that's what sparked my curiousity, and I wrote this.


As for why is it written in C++? Because I was in my "C++ Phase" back then. I also wanted it to be fast and work efficienctly on mobile devices too. 

Now I am releasing it at the age of 18 after some minor edits. Since now I don't have to study accountancy, this program isn't maintained anymore.
